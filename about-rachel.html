											<h3>My Journey to Fertility Awareness</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Driven to desperation by painful cramps during my period I went on the pill as a teenager. While that did give me a few years of being able to menstruate without getting dizzy and nauseous from pain eventually I began to feel disconnected from my body. During the years I had been on the pill I had frequently taken breaks but had always resumed taking it after a month or two of painful cramps, but a few months before I graduated from college I’d finally had enough.</p>
										<p>Determined to learn more about my body I delved into research on the female reproductive system and discovered the book, “Taking Charge of Your Fertility.” Naturally a detail-oriented person I fully embraced charting my cycle and tracked my cycles for a year and a half. After having a few charts that were difficult to interpret I decided to reach out to an instructor for help. </p>
										<p>Learning from an HRHP was almost as revolutionary for me as finding Taking Charge of Your Fertility. Not only did my understanding of cervical mucus exponentially increase, but I finally had confidence in my charting. What really caught me off guard was how delightfully bewildering it was to finally be listened to by a health care professional. My priorities were her priorities. And while she was careful to point out things she thought were important, it was still my choice to decide what we focused on in our work together. Typing these words out makes it feel so strange that I was surprised that I got to focus on my own health priorities, but the heartbreaking truth is that many of us struggle with having a voice in our own health because of the systemic power imbalances in healthcare.</p>
										<p>Immediately after working with an HRHP the pain from my menstrual cramps was cut in half and through our continued work we consistently reduced my pain. I finally feel like I know how to interpret what my body is trying to tell me, and it’s been wonderful to make that journey on a path of my own choosing. I truly feel that my HRHP was part of my healthcare team and having that support has been invaluable.</p>
